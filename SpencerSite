                <div class="innerContent">
                    <h3>I am an Industrial Engineering Student at the University of Toronto. I am very hardworking with
                        a passionate
                        attitude towards everything I create. Every project I take on, big or small, is crafted with a
                        strong attention to detail
                        and I am always proud of the finished product. I am a quick and avid learner, interested in
                        absorbing as much knowledge
                        as possible.</h3>
                    <br>

                    <h3>I am very focused on technology, as it is an extremely powerful tool. It's ability to have such
                        a substantial impact on
                        society drives me to dive deeper into this field. Specifically, areas such as UI and UX are of
                        great interest to myself as they
                        deal with how people use technology, and consequently the extent to which it has an effect in
                        their lives.
                    </h3>
                    <br>

                    <h3>Outside of academics and tech, I am also very interested in music. Having grown up in an
                        environment with an abundance of musical
                        instruments, and pursuing my high school education at an arts school, music has become an
                        essential part of my life. I believe that
                        my history with music has lead me to become a very creative person, and consequently has given
                        me a unique outlook on problem solving.
                        This has proven to be useful in tackling many problems faced throughout my academic career, as
                        well as in engineering.</h3>
